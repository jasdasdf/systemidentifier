Welcome to Nonlinear Signal Processing (nlsp)'s documentation!
==============================================================
.. some introduction to the library.

About:
   The Nonlinear Signal Processing (nlsp) is a python library which is written with the prime motive of modeling an artificial
   nonlinear system. It provides classes to generate a nonlinear system, identifying a nonlinear system, and analysing a
   nonlinear model.

   This nlsp library is the summary of the codes which I (Logeshwaran Thamilselvan) have written during my master thesis
   (Jan 2016 to July 2013) at HEAD acoustics GmbH under the supervision of Mr Jonas Schulte-Coerne.

Master Thesis:
   The final report of my thesis work can be found here :download:`/Logesh_Masterthesis.pdf`. This report can be used to
   get the theoretical information to use this library.

External Libraries:
   nlsp library depends on many standard python distributions which come with the python package and also with some other
   packages which are listed below.

   SuMPF:
      The nlsp library uses SuMPF package written by Jonas Schulte-Coerne, to do all the
      signal processing operations. The documentation of this package can be found here `SuMPF <http://jonassc.github.io/SuMPF/documentation/index.htm>`_.
      Thanks to Jonas for his well documented and helpful library.

   Numpy:
      The nlsp library uses the Numpy library to do numerical operations using an array.

   matplotlib:
      The nlsp library uses the matplotlib library to plot the audio signals and spectrums.
